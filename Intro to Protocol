The AMBA AHB protocol enables communication between multiple bus masters and slaves in a SoC. It provides a high-performance backbone for systems that require fast memory and peripheral access.

Core Components:
Masters (Managers): Initiate read/write operations.
Slaves (Subordinates): Respond to master requests.
Decoder: Maps address ranges to specific slaves.
Multiplexor: Routes slave outputs to master based on selection logic.
